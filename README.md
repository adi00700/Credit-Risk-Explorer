# Credit-Risk-Explorer

## Introduction

The objective of this project is to develop understanding of the concept of time value of money, fixed income securities and markets as well as interest rate derivatives.
I studied valuation and hedging using these instruments and discuss how these methods are used in practice. Furthermore, I demonstrated how to
apply different models for construction of yield curves, valuation and hedging using interest rate derivatives and estimating expected bond returns.

## Project phases

Each of the project phases has been logically separated based on things I am analysing and modeling. Every phase has a detailed description of all the steps,
implementation details, intuition for modeling, interpretation of data analysis, modeling and evaluation that was performed.

For each project phase there is a separate Jupyter Notebook file. You can view the nodebook directly here on the github (some cells might not be rendered correctly), under [/notebooks] folder, or you can copy the notebook link from github to view them with [Jupyter nbviewer].

`Note`: Jupyter's nbviewer will render output much better than the Github, but for both of them 3D plots and some other things won't be rendered. It's better to download the notebook files and open them with Google Collab, or use the following links to view them on a shared GDrive, after loggin in to your Google account:
